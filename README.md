# Building Models in R and Python

The purpose of this repository is to practice building models using football event data from StatsBomb using both R and Python. This models will be recreations of those already found online and maybe an attempt at creating our own player evaluation framework. 

## Helpful Articles

Here are a couple of helpful articles for obtaining StatsBomb data using R or Python.

## Models to be created

### Expected Goals
First we will create a basic expected goals model from which all other models can be built. 

### Expected Threat
Expected threat was created by Karun Singh with all information found on his [blog.](https://karun.in/blog/expected-threat.html). This initial blog provides a good overview of what the model consists of and some examples from the EPL. 

### Expected Possession Goals
Expected possession goals was created by the guys at [American Soccer Anlaysis](https://www.americansocceranalysis.com/home/2018/7/10/expected-possession-goals-the-value-of-a-possession-and-comparing-xpg-to-other-metrics) as a way of adding a value to possession. This metric uses an non-shot xG map from all over the pitch to provide values to a pass and the possession as a whole.
